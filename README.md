# Event_management_system
I developed this event management system using html , css , php , mysql .
Import the .sql file in your php myadmin to create the database and requrired tables.
Then keep these files in a folder.Move the folder to cdrive>>xampp>>htdocs.
Finally run this at localhost/your_foldername/open.php
